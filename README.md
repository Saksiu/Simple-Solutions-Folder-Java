# Simple-Solutions-Folder-Java

Solutions to common programming tasks using Java written by me.
Most of these come from leetcode.com or similar sites. This is my take on them.
All of them are executable and work within their described software and hardware limitations.

Here's a list of them with a short description of what they do:

1. RomanToArabic.java - Convert a given number written in the roman numerical system to an arabic numerical system.
2. SumOfArray.java - Adding up next numbers in series from an array and outputing increasing sums.
3. PivotIndex.java - Find an index of a number, that divides any integer array into two equal sums of integers.
4. IsomorphicStrings.java - Given two strings, determine wether they are Isomorphic.
5. IsSubsequence.java - Given two strings, determine wether one of them is a subsequence of another.
6. ReverseInteger.java - Reverse any 32bit number.
7. SameTree.java - Given 2 binary trees' roots determine wether they are identical.
8. FirstOccurence - Return the index of the first occurence of a given substring inside a given string.
