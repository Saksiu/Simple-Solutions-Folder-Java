# Simple-Solutions-Folder-Java

Solutions to common programming tasks using Java written by me.
Most of these come from leetcode.com or similar sites. This is my take on them.
All of them are executable and work within their described software and hardware limitations.

Here's a list of them with a short description of what they do:

1. RomanToArabic.java - A simple program with a function converting a given number written in the roman numerical system to an arabic numerical system.
2. SumOfArray.java - Very simple program adding up next numbers in series from an array and outputing increasing sums.
